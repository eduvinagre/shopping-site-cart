## My process

First I plan going throug what I wanted step by step. Then I started hard coding the HTML and CSS before I started the JavaScript so I could see things working as my work developed. I made more clear the path I was going throug and made dificulties more ease to overcome.

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- API

### What I learned

Improved my skills working with logic, local storage, arrow functions, asynch and DOM manipulation

### Continued development

I now look forward going back on this project in a future so I can add more features to it
